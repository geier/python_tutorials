Python Tutorials
################

This repository contains a bunch of tutorials covering:

* python
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* and more

While these tutorials are meant to be used in an interactive, small-group
classroom-like setting with an instructor, most of it should be pretty self
explanatory. 

Howto
=====

Clone this repository, navigate to it with jupyterlab or jupyter notbook and
click on one of the .ipynb files.
